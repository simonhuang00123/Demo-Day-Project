        <h2>Why Laziness is Bad</h2>
        <p>Laziness is a huge problem that society suffers from. Without laziness, we would all be accomplishing our dreams and very successful. Without laziness, motivation would not even be needed. To be successful, you have to put in a lot of effort and laziness stops us from doing that.</p>

        <h2>How to Overcome Laziness</h2>
        <p>Most of the time, people are lazy because the things that they want to do or need to do are no fun. They release no less dopamine in the person's brain when compared to other things they do. For exmample, if somebody plays video games most of the day, their brain will get used to the higher amounts of dopamine. Over time, they will find it hard to do tasks like their homework because they release less dopamine. This is just like a drug addiction. In order to overcome this, you must be willing to change and start doing tasks that you find boring. Your brain will get used to this and this will allow you progress to harder tasks. In short, the more dedicated and effort </p>

        <h2>My story</h2>
        <p>I myself was a very lazy person not too long ago. I was addicted to video games and this led to me not wanting to put effort into anything but video games. My achievements in school suffered and I was only doing homework once a week. Eventualy I wanted to change and started to push myself to do tasks that I did not want to do because of how lazy I was. I started progressing back to a more healthy life and was able to work very hard since. Now I am a 4.0 unweighted student that is taking multiple AP classes. </p>
